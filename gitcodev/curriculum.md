# Curriculum

Version control is an esential tool in software development. It enables the tracking of changes in the code source, and the management of multiple versions. Git is version control system that allows asyncronous development, and currently, the most popular version control system. 

Collaborative development is a software development approach that can help researchers to organize their software project, foster collaboration among their peers and create a community around open source research software.
Researchers involved or experting to get invovled in the developing of research software can benefit greatly of mastering the basics of collaborative development.

## Course Units

This course is organized into lessons, episodos and topic. The course consist of **Lessons**. Each Lesson is further divided into **Episodes**, and then into **Topics**. The order in which lessons, episodes and topic is organized is the result of extensive descussions on the best way to develiver the course to an audience with little to intermediate previous experience and knowldege, and the experience gather from delivering the course to two groups of mostly PhD cantidates.
