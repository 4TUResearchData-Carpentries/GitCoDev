# Curriculum

Version control is an essential tool in software development. It enables the tracking of changes in the code source and the management of multiple versions. Git is a version control system that allows asynchronous development and is currently the most popular version control system. 

Collaborative development is a software development approach that can help researchers organise their software projects, foster collaboration among their peers and create a community around open-source research software.
Researchers involved or expecting to be involved in developing research software can benefit greatly from mastering the basics of collaborative development.


## Prerequisites

Knowledge and experience in using the command-line interface (CLI) with Unix Shell to perform the following tasks:

* to navigate and visualise the content of directories (folders);
* to create, copy, move and delete files and directories;
* to edit files with terminal-based text editors (such as Nano, vim, emacs, etc);
* to visualise hidden files and directories;
* to redirect and append a command output to a file.

## Tools and Materials

* Unix Shell.
* Git.
* GitHub account or account on a similar platform.
* A laptop with administrative privileges running MacOS, Linux or Windows.

## Course Units

This course is organised in lessons, episodes and topics. The course consists of **Lessons**. 
Each Lesson is divided into **Episodes** and then into **Topics**. The order in which lessons, 
episodes and topics are organised is the result of extensive discussions on the best way to deliver 
the course. The following aspects played a key role in the organisation:

*  The audience of the course are researchers with previous experience and knowledge at a level between beginner and intermediate user. 
*  Feedback and experiences gathered from delivering the content in three different occasions where most of the audience were PhD candidates. 

The learning objectives and topics of each lesson are presented below. The taxon according to [Bloom's revised taxonomy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Bloom%27s_revised_taxonomy.svg) is indicated in parenthesis.
