Provide an introduction in the form of a short lecture on code reviews and their importance in collaborative software development. The following are some points to present and discuss with the participants:
* Reasons for code reviews:
    * Sharing knowledge
    * Spreding ownership
    * Unifiying development practices
    * Quality control

The instructor demonstrates how to conduct a code review on the collaborative platform used in the course (GitHub, GitLab, etc.). The instructor can use the pull request created in the previous exercise as an example. Depending on the platform, the instructor can show how to:

* Assign reviewers to a pull request/merge request.
* Add comments to the code.
* Suggest changes to the code.
* Approve the pull request/merge request.
* Merge the pull request/merge request into the main branch.
* Close the pull request/merge request.
