# Schedule
The course consists of four lessons, and a lesson per day is a good way to deliver the content. 
Our experience has shown that participants prefer four consecutive days. 
However, adapting the schedule to different audiences is a very reasonable approach. 

## Lessons
Lessons are organized so that participants are gradually introduced to the content. 
The content of subsequent lessons depends on previous lessons; therefore, 
we discourage changing the order of the lessons. 
Refer to [our teaching approach](teaching-approach) to learn why the order of the lessons matters in this course.

| Lessons | Day |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Lesson 1      | Day 1   |
| Lesson 2      | Day 2   |
| Lesson 3      | Day 3   |
| Lesson 4      | Day 4   |

## Sessions
A lesson has been designe to be delivered in one session. In our experience, 
the legth of a session should be at least four hours, but we do not recommend to exceed four and a half hours.  
The content of each lesson has been optimized to provide the content in a way that reduces the cognitive load of the participants. 
We recommend delivering each lesson following the following timetable.


| 00:00  | 00:50 | 01:00 | 01:50 | 02:10 | 03:00 | 03:10 | 04:00 | 04:10 |
|:-------|:------|:------|:------|:------|:------|:------|:------|:------|
| Teaching 50' | **Break 10'** | Teaching 50' | **Break 20'** | Teaching 50' | **Break 10'** | Teaching  50'| **Wrap-up 10'** | Closure |


`````{important}
If a session must be longer than what it is suggested above, we recommend to extend the *teaching* 
times up to 60 minutes, but maintaining the duration and frequency of the *breaks*.
