# Schedule
The course consists of four lessons, and a lesson per day is a good way to deliver the content. Our experience has shown that participants prefer four consecutive days. However, adapting the schedule to different audiences is a very reasonable approach. 

## Lessons
Lessons are organized so that participants are gradually introduced to the content. The content of subsequent lessons depends on previous lessons; therefore, we discourage the change of the lesson. Refer to [our teaching approach](teaching-approach) to learn why the order of the lessons matters in this course.

| Lessons | Day |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Lesson 1      | Day 1   |
| Lesson 2      | Day 2   |
| Lesson 3      | Day 3   |
| Lesson 4      | Day 4   |

## Sessions
Each lesson has been designed to be delivered in four and a half-hour sessions. 
The content of each lesson has been optimized to provide the lesson in a way that reduces the cognitive overload of
the participants. We recommend delivering each lesson following the following timetable.


| 00:00  | 01:00 | 01:10 | 02:00 | 02:20 | 03:10 | 03:20 | 04:10 | 04:30 |
|:-------|:------|:------|:------|:------|:------|:------|:------|:------|
| Lesson 60' | **Break 10'** | Lesson 50' | **Break 20'** | Lesson 60' | **Break 10'** | Lesson  50'| **Wrap-up 10'** | Closure |
