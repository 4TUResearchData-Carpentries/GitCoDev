# Schedule


## Lessons

The course consist of four lessons, and in our experience a lesson per day seems a good way to deliver the content. Our experience has shown that four consecutive days seems to be prefered by participants. However, adaptig the schedule to different audiences is a very reasonable approach. 

Lessons are organized in such a way that participants are gradually introduced to the content. The conent of subsequent lessons depend on the content of previous lessons; therefore we discourage to change of the lesson. Refer to the teachign appoacht to understand why this is important. 

| Lessons | Day |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Lesson 1      | Day 1   |
| Lesson 2      | Day 2   |
| Lesson 3      | Day 3   |
| Lesson 4      | Day 4   |

## Sessions

Each lesson has been designed to be delivered in sessions of four and a half hours. 
The content of each lesson has been optimized to be delivered in a way that the congnitive overload on
the participants is reduced. We recommend to delive each lesson following the following timetable.


| 00:00  | 01:00 | 01:10 | 02:00 | 02:20 | 03:10 | 03:20 | 04:10 | 04:30 |
