## Preparation

````{admonition} Instructor's Note 
The instructor must collect particiapant's user names for GitHub/Gitlab the day before, so that they can be invited to collaborative repositories.
We recommend a [Google form](https://forms.gle/asj6dAhTh6vcyUhV9), or similar solution.
````

The following helps the instructor to set up a terminal that will show the history of command from one terminal in another. This helps participant to keep track of what commands have been typed by the instructor.  

1. On main terminal:
```bash
 export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
```
2. On second (history) terminal:
```bash
 tail -f ~/.bash_history | nl -w 3
```

## i. Recapitulation Operations with Remotes [5 min]

Common operations with remotes

````{adminition}
* Recap slide on how local repostories and remotes are connected and how to work with remotes (Slides).
* Recap what `clone, fetch, merge, pull` and `push` commands do.
````

## Episode 1: Collaborative Platforms

### 3.1.1. Connecting to Code Repositories  [ 10 min]

* Ask participants using Windows not to start Git Bash clicking on the desktop icon, as they did in Lesson 1. Instead,
    * use the app menu (the Windows logo)
    * pick up Git Bash from the list
    * launch Git Bash with the option **Run as administrator** available from the drop-down submenu.
    The participants need to type in their credentials as local administrators.
This gain authority to have SSH installing its own features in their laptop next.

```{admonition} Instructor's Note
At their very first `git push`, Git might complain about a mismatch between the credentials of local and global administrator.
The warning itself suggests another Git command as the remedy to this impasse.
```

#### Setting up SSH connection for GitHub

````{admonition} Instructor's Note
GitHub requires authentication via SSH to do pulls and pushes, but not for cloning. **Use slides** to explain what a SSH connection entitles.
````

* Ask participants to test the connection with:
    ```shell
        ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

* To connect via SSH do the following:

    1. Create a Key-pair inside the `.ssh`  in the Home directory
        ```shell
            # move to Home directory
            cd ~
            # create key
            ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
            # save to the default location and file name: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```

    2. Check the keys have been created
        ```shell
            ls ~/.ssh/
        ```

    3. Start the `ssh-agent` and add private key to agent:
        ```shell
            # start agent
            eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

            # add private key
            ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```
    4. Instruct SSH to use key files in different locations:
        ```shell
            ssh -i <path/private/keyfile>
        ```

    ````{admonition} Instructor's Note
    Window's user would need to set up the *ssh-agent** to [start the automatically](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases#auto-launching-ssh-agent-on-git-for-windows)
    Mac and Linux user don't have to worry about this.
    ````
5. Copy public key to GitHub:
    ```shell
        clip < .ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

````{admonition} Instructor's Note
Go to GitHub, explain the basics of the interface and
````

6. add the SSH key.
    ```shell
        Profile > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key > Add SSH key
    ```

7. Test SSH connection
    ```shell
        ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

````{admonition} Instructor's Note
The message for a successful outcome is friendly and plain.Ask participants whether git@github.com has welcomed them.

* More information on working with [SSH keys and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
* Check the info on [Troubleshooting SSH for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh).
````

#### 2. Publishing Local Repository to GitHub [5 min]

1. Create GitHub Repo: Go to Github and create an public empty repository called `workshop`. Repo description: *workshop on collaborative development*

2. Add Remote to Local Repo: before this remove any existing remotes in the repository with: `git remote remove <name>`

Move back to the repo directory: `~/Desktop/`
In your local repository (on the terminal), add the remote repository and push the content.

* Connect to remote
    ```shell
        git remote add origin git@github.com:<user-name>/<repo-name>.git
    ```

* Check that remote was added
    ```shell
        git remote -v
        git branch -M main # [Optional if config was changed. This will change the name of the main branch of the repo to make it more friendly]
        git push -u origin main
    ```

#### 3. Check the Content's Repositoy is in GitHub
Go back to your repo page and refresh the browser.

### 3.1.2. Exploring the GitHub GUI [5 min]

Collaborative platform host and manage remote repositories to enable collaborative development.

````{admonition} Instructor's Notes
Ask participants if they are familiar with GitHub. If not, give a short explanation of what it is for how to explore the GUI.

Mention GitLab at TU Delft as an alternative for a collaborative platform: https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/
````

### 3.1.3. Collaborating [ 5 min ]

Participants are invited as collaborators to the **check-in** repository. Participants must have permission to merge pull requets.

1. Demo on how to invite collaborators using the [check-in repository.](https://github.com/manuGil/check-in)

2. Paticipant accept inviation via email or GitHub GUI.

## Episode 2: Collaborative Development for Research Software

### 3.2.1.  Introduction to Collaboration [3 min]

```{admonition} Instructor's Note

* An Quick introduction to collaborative development. Definitions  (Slides).

* Developing high quality software requires more than programming and technical skill. Exceptionally good programmers can produce high quality software by themselves. But good programmers will need to collaborate in order to develop complex, high quality software.

```

### 3.2.2. When to Aim for a Collaborative Approach? [2 min]

```{admonition} Instructor's Note
Explain the difference between private and close collaboration
```

#### 3. Management Strategies [5 min]

> Explain why management is important for developing software, the key factors to consider, and recommend a management strategy.

**Key Factors:**
- Purpose
- People
- Time
- Maintenance

*ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES*

> Describe the responsibilities for each role and why they are important for a research-software development project.

**Roles:**
- Project owner
- Administrator
- Reviewer
- Collaborator

> Questions? [10 min]

#### EXERCISE 2: Roles and Responsibilities [6 min]

> Participant make teams, decide on roles and name their teams.

1. Make teams of 3 or 4 people. They will work together during group exercises.
2. Assign roles and responsibilities to each member; you should and up with:
    - One project owner
    - One administrator
    - One or more collaborators
    - Zero or more reviewers
3. Choose a name for the team.

-----------------

## PART 2

### A. Collaborative Workflows [8 min]

#### 1. Issues

Document and track ideas and tasks in a development project. Theyâ€™re facilitate planning, discussing  and tracking the progress of a software project.

> Do-along on how to crate issues in a repository. Use the recently pushed repository.

Collaborative workflows are estrategies to organise the work of a developer team so that many developers can contribute to a software project. Two common estrategies that use version control and collaborative platforms as leverage are:

- The **branching workflow** and
- The **forking workflow**

>  A short explanation on branching workflow (slides)

#### EXERCISE 3: Branching workflow [15 min]

Teams work on coding taks using the branch worflow model.

1. [Administrator] Creates a repository using [this template](https://github.com/the-magnificents/collab-branching)
2. [Administrator] Invites all team members to the team's repository as collaborators.
3. [Team] Read the `TODO.md` file and each member choses a tasks for the next step.
4. [Collaborator] each member opens an issue  for the chosen  task.
5. [Collaborator] Apply the branching model to complete the chosen task.
6. [Collaborator] Commit and push changes to the team's repository.

#### 2. Pull requests [ 5 min]

> ask if they already have experience with making pull request.

Explain what they are and teams follow the steps to create a pull request from their branch to the main branch.

#### EXERCISE 4: Pull requests [6 min]

Working as a team merge the changes made in the previous exercise into the main branch of the teamâ€™s repository.
1. [Collaborators] create a pull request for their own branch.
    - Give your pull request a meaning name, and a short description.
2. Are there any conflicts? Resolve them using the GitHuB GUI. Ask for help if you need to.
3. [Collaborators] Merge the pull request to the main branch using the method of their choice.
4. Check the main branch to confirm that your changes have been merged.

#### 3. Forking workflow [5 min]

>  A short explanation on fork workflow (slides)

#### EXERCISE 5: Forking workflow [15 min]

working in teams, apply FAIR principle to a Git repository using a [FAIR software checklist.](https://tu-delft-dcc.github.io/software/checklist.html)

1. [Administrator] creates a repository for the team using the [collab-faircode template repository](https://github.com/the-magnificents/collab-faircode). As name for the reposotory use <team-name>-faircode
3. [Team] Go thru the Fair software checklist and assign one item from the list to each member.
3. [Collaborator] open an issue about the item you chose.
2. [Collaborator] fork the team's repository to their accounts.
4. [Collaborator] Clone their fork to their local machine, make changes to address ther issue and push changes to their forks.
5. [Collaborator] Make a pull request from your fork to the base repository.
