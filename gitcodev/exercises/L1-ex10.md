# Lesson 1 Episode 3 --- Load committed versions in the working tree
Please perform the following tasks individually

1. Modify the file in the working tree at your pleasure recalling the versions in the history. The Git commands below may help you there (their order is just alphabetical)
    ```shell
    git diff HEAD~m Lines.txt
    git log --oneline
    git restore --sources HEAD~n Lines.txt
    ```
    where $m$ and $n$ are integers of your liking, including $0$

````{attention}
REQUIRED for the continuation (but not as a rule)
    1. DO NOT STAGE OR COMMIT
    2. Make sure that you finish with a clean working tree at HEAD
````
Formulate your own explanation of what you have observed
The following questions are two sides of the same coin:
* **What did you ask Git to do?**
* **What did Git do for you?**

````{attention}
Are there shortcuts to do the same with less typing?
