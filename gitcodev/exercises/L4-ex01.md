# Lesson 4 Recapitulation --- Implementing a Collaborative Workflow 
**Time: 15 min**

Working in teams, define and implement a workflow of your choice (branching/forking) to collaborate in a repository. Names between `[]` indicate who in the team should engage in each activity.

1. [**Administrator**] create a repository for the team using the template: https://github.com/WorkshopGitcodev/collab-review
2. [**Team**] discuss and agree on which workflow to implement for this exercise.
3. [**Team**] each member choses one task from the `faircode-checklist.md` and make changes.
4. [**Team**] each member opens a pull request to the `main` branch with the their changes **Important: Do not merge.**
5. [**Team**] each member makes some other changes to the repository, commits and push. 
6. [**Team**] go back to your pull request and see how the latest changes affected your pull request. **Do not merge.**
