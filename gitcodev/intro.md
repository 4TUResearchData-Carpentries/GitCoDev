# Introduction

This website describes a curriculum for a short course on *Version Control and collaboratie Development for Research Software*. 
The content has been designed specifically for the instructors ('train the trainers') and not for the learners. A derivative document suited to learners would require adapted design, format and distribution.


## Why do we need a new course on version control?

To any educator reading this, it will be evident that having new topics to teach is not the only reason for designing new teaching materials. 
Changes in learning objectives, the target audience, or the teaching approaches are also valid reasons to 
design and develop new teaching materials.  
Therefore, we could answer the question: *why do we need a new course  about version control with Git?* by simple stating: *this course has different learning objective and teaching approaches*. 

However, more curious readers would like to know in which ways it is different. Which objectives  and teaching approaches are different? 
How does these materials compared to the ones by author 'A' or organisation 'O'? 
Which topics are different? and How different are they? 
Are these materials better those in course 'C'?
Proving scientific evidence of the differences in this course will require to spend a considerable amount of time in disecting, analysing and comparing any these course with other courses covering simialr topics out there. 
We have deliverly chosen to not engage in that endevour; instead, we have chosen to put our efforts to better use and focus on improving the way version control and collaborative development is thaught to researchers in technical univesities.

Therefore, we do not provide anwers to the questions listed above. Though, we do not mean to discourage anyone, 
who wishes to put the effort on finding answers, from pursuing so. 
Instead, we explain what our motivation for developing this course is, and hope that will sufy readers who share our motivation. We encourge them to adopt, adapt and reuse the contents of this course.

## Motivation

After teaching introductory courses on version control using Git at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/), 
recurring feedback provided by participants, mainly early-carreer reseachers such as PhD candiates and post-docs, made evident that such courses were highly appreciated and interesting. However, participants also often mentioned that after the courses, they did not feel confident in applying what was learned to their own research.
And they did not know how they could apply the recently adquired skills to their research projects, 
even when such projects involve writing code for themselves or for their research groups.

On the other had, during my role as a research software engineer, I often find myself explaining early-carreer and well-stablished researchers how to adopt and adapt practices that are common in collaborative software development into their work and the work of their research groups. That meant that I could spend less time contributing directly to the development of their research sofware. In more than one case, the benefits of changing the way researchers approach development of research software werer evident. 
However, in those cases there was also an innitial reluctance in changing they way developing research software was made. 

These experiences convinced me that researchers will benefit from understading what software development entitles and adopt some of the best practices without they needing to become sofware engineers themselves. 
If  that could be achived, research software will be of better quality, software as a research output would be easier to maintain which will increase the likelihood of research results to be reproducible for a longer time, the productity among researchers that continously engage in the development of research software can be increase; and the time spent on direclty working on research software, as a software engineer, could be increased to the benefit of the researchers themselves. 

In summary, there are two situations that motived the development of this course. Firts, the need to increase the level of confidence and independece in applying version control to research sofware among researcher attending similar courses. And second, our enthusiasm to help researchers to adopt best practices in collaborative development to foster their productivity and improve the quality of research software.
