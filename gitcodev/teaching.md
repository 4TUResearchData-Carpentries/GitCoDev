# Teaching Philosophy

The content, acivities and delivery aproach of this course have been designed with one goal in mind:
*help researchers to build **independence** and **self-reliance** when using version control and collaborative development in research software projects.*  

To fullfill such goal, we have organized the content in four lessons. The first lessson is an introduction to the fundamentals of Git. The second lesson builds on the knowledge and skills of the first lesson and focuses on the use of branches and remote repositories. The third lesson introduces the topic of collaborative software development were the skills and knowledge from the first and second lessons are used to effectively collaborate via platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. Finally, the fourth lesson focuses selection of best practices for managing collaboration, and licensing and releasing software. 

## Teaching Approach

To build self-reliance and indenpencence among participants this course adopts a unique teaching approach. Self-reliance is built by gradually increasing the level of experise required to complete excercises as participants move from one lesson to another. At the same time, the detail in the instructions of the exercises is reduced withouth compromising clarity. The [teaching approach graph](approach-fig) illustrates this.

Self-reliance is also build through engaging participants in indivual and team assigment. Indivual assigments are designed to create indiviuals that can apply skills confidently. While, team assignment are designed to achieve the same when working with other software developers. 
We have condensed the teaching approach in two principles.

### Self-reliance Principle

*Self-relience is built by gradully reducing the dependency of instruction's guidence when engaining in learning activities.* Learning activities in this course are designed to gradually build self-reliance on the participants. Therefore, content and exercises are designed so that participants work gradually more independently from instructor's guidence, and plan and execute assignments by themselves.

### Team-experience Principle

*Some skills can be mastered through individual efforts, others must be mastered through experiences in software development teams.* 
Excercise are divided in two categories. **Individual excersise** are prevalent in lessons one and two, and they focus on acquire skills that are fundamental to version control and collaborative development. 
During lesson three, participants form teams of three or four to undertake **team assignments**. The goal of team assignments is to expose participants to situations that are common among development teams working in a collaborative software project.
