# Teaching Philosophy

The content, exercisises and delivery of this course has been designed with one goal in mind:
*help researchers to build **independence** and **self-reliance** when using version control and collaborative development in research software projects.*  

To fullfill such goal, we have organized the content in four lessons. The first lessson is an introduction to the fundamentals of Git. The second lesson builds on the knowledge and skills of the first lesson and focuses on the use of branches and remote repositories. The third lesson introduces the topic of collaborative software development were the skills and knowledge from the first and second lessons are used to effectively collaborate via platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. Finally, the fourth lesson focuses selection of best practices for managing collaboration, and licensing and releasing software. 

Teaching approach:
Whether you work individually or in a group, version control is essential in research software development. Setting up a workflow for managing your research software development leverages a research project and the quality of its outputs.
The workshops consists of four session:
Fundamentals operations with Git: introduction to version control, tracking changes, and the tracking history.
Branching and remote operations: using branches, and remote repositories.
Collaborative software development: collaborative development, and platforms.
Collaborative software development: workflows, and good practices.
Through sessions 1 and 2, participants will learn through practical exercises individually, and in sessions 3 and 4, participants will team up to engage in exercises related to collaborative development. 

## Self-Reliance Principle

Parcitipant develop self-relience by gradully reducing the instruction's guidence when completing activities.    
The activities in this course are designed to gradually build self-reliance on the participants. Therefore, content and exercises are designed so that participants work gradually more independently from instructor's guidence, and plan and execute assignments by themselves.


## Experience Principle

Some skills can be mastered by individuals, others must be mastered through experience with development teams.
