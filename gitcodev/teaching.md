# Teaching Philosophy

Teaching approach:
Whether you work individually or in a group, version control is essential in research software development. Setting up a workflow for managing your research software development leverages a research project and the quality of its outputs.
The workshops consists of four session:
Fundamentals operations with Git: introduction to version control, tracking changes, and the tracking history.
Branching and remote operations: using branches, and remote repositories.
Collaborative software development: collaborative development, and platforms.
Collaborative software development: workflows, and good practices.
Through sessions 1 and 2, participants will learn through practical exercises individually, and in sessions 3 and 4, participants will team up to engage in exercises related to collaborative development. 
The activities and exercises during the workshop are designed to gradually build self-reliance on the part of participants. Therefore, content and exercises are designed so that participants work gradually more independently from instructors, and plan and execute solutions by themselves.
